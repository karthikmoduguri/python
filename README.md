#Map concept

The map() function in Python is a powerful built-in function that allows you to apply a given function to all items in an iterable (like a list or a string) and returns a map object (which is an iterator) containing the results.

Syntax:
map(function, iterable)
function: This is the function that will be applied to each item of the iterable. It could be a normal function, a lambda function, or any function that takes one argument and returns a value.

iterable: This is the iterable (e.g., list, tuple, string) whose items will be passed to the function one by one.

Key Points:
map returns an iterator, so you need to convert it into a list (or other iterables like set, tuple) to access the results.

Itâ€™s particularly useful for applying the same operation to each item in a collection.
